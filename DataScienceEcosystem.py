# ### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python
# 
# Below are a few examples of how arithmetic expressions can be evaluated in Python:
# 
# **sum**
#    result = 5 + 3
# **Subtraction**
#    result = 10 - 4
# **Multiplication**
#    result = 10*4
# 

# In[5]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3*4) + 5
result


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
